			<h1> Data Brokers </h1>
			<h2> The third party companies you never knew exsisted </h2>

			<time> Who are they?  </time>
			<p>

Sharing your data online is typically seen as a two-way transaction between the user giving
the data and a recipient receiving data; An example of this would be someone creating an
account for a social media platform such as Facebook. The user willing gives vital
information such as first/last name, date of birth, hobbies, and interest, in order to
create an accurate profile. This seamless harmless transaction is being eavesdropped by 3rd
party data companies, which is a catch term for Data Brokers. Data Brokers are tasked with
collecting online data that ranges across all online platforms (email, public records, etc).
The data they collect includes information about first/last names, addresses, income,
shopping habits, and much more. With the information they gather from across the internet,
Data Brokers create a virtual online profile of an individual. They then sell these
profiles to advertisers, social media sites, credit agencies, insurers, law enforcement,
other data companies, and many more. Data Brokers have been around for a long time, and
essentially everyone in the United States is included in at least 1 Database. Acxiom,
one of the leading data collection companies, says it has information on 500 million
people worldwide, including nearly "every US Citizen" (source). It is a very lucrative
business as well, Acxiom was able to clear 800 million dollars in yearly revenue.
Data Brokers are the unseen eyes of the virtual world, watching and collecting every
little piece of information we leave behind on the internet.

			<time> How do they do it? Too what extend can they share my data?  </time>
			<p>


How do they extract our data right from under our nose? They collect our data from a variety
of sources, many that you never knew were selling you're data to these data companies. One of
the first sources comes from the state itself, the company's such as Experian, cite
information from the United state census and phone book. The most used methods is embedding
lines of code (using cookies and pixels) into millions of websites that identify the user once
they click on a website, which triggers their browsing history to get recorded. Companies
mainly use the browsing history for target advertising, and to create an online profile of youre interest
(health, political views , socially, etc). It's not only limited to the things we buy, in the
2012 election companies were able to match you're voting records with your cookie on you're
computer, allowing candidates to target you with specific ads (Republican or Democrat). The
seconds most used method comes from E-mail tracking, this may seem impossible but all it
takes is one line of code. It works by embedding a line of code into the body of the email,
a 1x1 pixel image, barely visible even for the most avid internet users. With this tracker,
companies know whether the email was opened, when it was opened, and where it was opened,
newsletter services have been doing this for years. The shop/services you use online are
also one of the biggest perpetrators in the data sharing market, by stating the privacy
policies of the website that you're data will be sold to "trusted" third parties, which
are data companies. Companies are often very vague off who they give your data too,
very few companies are fully transparent off whom they give your information too.
There are very few laws and regulations regarding the process, however, there are
still some records they don't have access too. They cannot have access to you're
medical records or conversation history with a doctor, and they cannot use
information that determines your credit-worthiness, or eligibility for
employment/housing. Regardless of these few regulations, companies can still
know what type of health you are in based on your search history. If you search
up an allergy that you suffer from, companies like  Acxiom sells data on whether
the person has a "likelihood" of buying a medical prescription for their allergy.
Almost anything on the internet and in public records is essentially fair
game for Data Brokers to record and sell to other companies, raising the
question of how do we keep our data safe while on the internet?

	<time> How does this effect me? Can I prevent it? </time>

	<p color="red">


The Main way that this effects you is through the use of target advertising.
When you go on Nike to look a pair of shoes but don't end up buying them,
there's a high chance that on the next few websites you visit, there will
be targeted ads for the same shoe. This isn't only limited to commercial
goods, services that best fit you're online profiled based on your data
will also be advertised directly towards you. This direct form of
advertising can make you feel uncomfortably vulnerable while online.
How can we prevent this from happening? Some companies allow you to have
the option to "opt-out", however, this task is extremely tedious and is
very hard to go through fully. In order to opt-out effectively you have
to have to know all the different data brokers and find there op-out
agreements which majority of consumers don't know how to access. Some
data companies do not offer opt-out agreements, and with the hundreds
of data brokers that exist, it is not possible to keep your data
clean off every database.

		<p>

			Data Brokers are tasked with collecting the trail of data we leave on a variety of online
			platforms, which creates virtual profiles which are sold to companies for a variety of
			reasons that range from financial to political and other beneficial sectors. They are the
			unseen eyes of the online world that track all the data we willing and unwilling reveal
			in order to benefit themselves and other companies. By being aware of this third-party
			presence, we can better protect our self from our data being included in online databases
			by being more aware of the information we relay online. The best way to feel more secure
			online is by reading user agreements and their policies involving data sharing.
			With this information, you are now better prepared to navigate the internet, knowing
			that there is a 3rd eye watching you online.
